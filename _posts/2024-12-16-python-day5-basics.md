## **Introduction**

Input statements in Python allow you to accept data from the user during program execution. This interaction makes programs dynamic, adaptable, and more user-friendly. By understanding how to use input statements efficiently, you can build Python applications that respond effectively to user input.

---

## **How Input Statements Work**

In Python, the built-in `input()` function is used to capture user input. It reads the input as a **string** by default, but you can convert it into other data types, such as integers or floats, depending on your needs.

---

## **Syntax of the `input()` Function**

```python
input("Prompt message")
```

- **Prompt message**: An optional string displayed to the user, explaining what input is required.
- The `input()` function **pauses program execution** until the user provides input and presses *Enter*.

---

## **Basic Input Example**

Letâ€™s start with a simple example where we ask for the userâ€™s name and print a greeting message.

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello, " + name + "!")
```

**Output:**

```
Enter your name: Charishma  
Hello, Charishma!
```

Here:
- The user is prompted to enter their name.
- The input is stored in the variable `name` and then displayed using a `print` statement.

---

## **Taking Numerical Input**

Since the `input()` function returns a string, you need to explicitly convert it to a numerical type like `int` or `float` to perform arithmetic operations.

**Example:**

```python
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
print("Sum:", num1 + num2)
```

**Output:**

```
Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 20  
Sum: 30
```

Here:
- The `int()` function converts the string input to integers.
- This allows you to perform numerical operations like addition.

---

## **Taking Multiple Inputs in a Single Line**

If you need to accept multiple inputs at once, you can use the `split()` method. This divides the input string into separate values.

**Example:**

```python
a, b = input("Enter two numbers separated by space: ").split()
a = int(a)
b = int(b)
print("Product:", a * b)
```

**Output:**

```
Enter two numbers separated by space: 5 4  
Product: 20
```

Here:
- The `split()` function splits the input based on spaces.
- The two inputs are then converted to integers using `int()`.

---

## **Accepting Float Input**

For decimal numbers, you can use the `float()` function to convert the input to a floating-point number.

**Example:**

```python
height = float(input("Enter your height in meters: "))
print("Your height is", height, "meters.")
```

**Output:**

```
Enter your height in meters: 1.75  
Your height is 1.75 meters.
```

Here, the `float()` function ensures the input is treated as a decimal value.

---

## **Advanced Input: Default Values**

Python allows you to assign a **default value** if no input is provided by the user. This can be achieved using the `or` operator.

**Example:**

```python
name = input("Enter your name (default: User): ") or "User"
print("Welcome,", name)
```

**Output:**

```
Enter your name (default: User):  
Welcome, User
```

Here:
- If the user provides no input (simply presses *Enter*), the value "User" is assigned as the default.

---

## **Key Tips for Using Input Statements**

1. **Always validate user input**: Use conditional statements or exception handling to ensure the input is of the expected type.
2. **Use prompts effectively**: Clear and concise prompts make it easier for users to understand what input is required.
3. **Convert data types**: Remember that `input()` returns a string. Use `int()`, `float()`, or other methods as needed.
4. **Handle multiple inputs**: Use `split()` to take multiple inputs in a single line for efficiency.

---

## **Conclusion**

Input statements are an essential part of Python programming, enabling user interaction and dynamic behavior. The `input()` function is simple yet powerful, especially when combined with data type conversion and string methods. By mastering input statements, you can create interactive, user-friendly Python programs that effectively meet user needs.
