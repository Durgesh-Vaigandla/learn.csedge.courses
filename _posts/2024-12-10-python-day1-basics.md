## **Understanding Variables and Keywords**  

### **Variables**  
A variable is a named memory location used to store data. In Python, variables are dynamically typed, so thereâ€™s no need to specify the type explicitly. For example:  

```python
name = "Charishma"  # String variable
age = 20            # Integer variable
pi = 3.14           # Float variable
```  

### **Keywords**  
Python keywords are reserved words that cannot be used as variable names. Examples include `if`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `True`, `False`, etc. Here's an example:  

```python
if age > 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
```
