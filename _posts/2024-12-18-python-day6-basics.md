## Introduction

Control statements are the backbone of Python programming, directing how your code executes. These essential constructs allow you to create efficient, logical, and dynamic programs. Let's explore their types and practical uses.

## Conditional Statements

### if-else Statements
```python
# Basic if-else
age = 18
if age >= 18:
        print("Adult")
else:
        print("Minor")
```

### elif Chains
```python
score = 85
if score >= 90:
        grade = 'A'
elif score >= 80:
        grade = 'B'
else:
        grade = 'C'
```

### Match-Case (Python 3.10+)
```python
status = 404
match status:
        case 200:
                print("Success")
        case 404:
                print("Not Found")
        case _:
                print("Unknown")
```

## Loops

### For Loops
```python
# Iterating over a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']
for fruit in fruits:
        print(fruit)

# Using range
for i in range(3):
        print(i)  # Outputs: 0, 1, 2
```

### While Loops
```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
        print(count)
        count += 1
```

## Control Keywords

- `break`: Exit loop immediately
- `continue`: Skip to next iteration
- `pass`: Empty placeholder
- `return`: Exit function

## Best Practices

1. Keep conditions simple
2. Use meaningful variable names
3. Avoid deep nesting
4. Consider using guard clauses
5. Add comments for complex logic

## Common Pitfalls

- Infinite loops
- Off-by-one errors
- Complex nested conditions
- Missing break statements

Remember: Clear, readable code is often better than clever, complex solutions.
