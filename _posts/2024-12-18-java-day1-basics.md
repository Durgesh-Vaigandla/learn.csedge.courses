## What is Java?

Java is a robust, high-level programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). Known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" capability, Java powers everything from mobile apps to enterprise software.

## Key Features of Java

1. **Platform Independence**
    - Runs on any device with a JVM
    - True "Write Once, Run Anywhere" functionality
    - Bytecode compatibility across platforms

2. **Object-Oriented**
    - Built around classes and objects
    - Supports inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism
    - Promotes modular and reusable code
    - Interface and abstract class support

3. **Security & Reliability**
    - Strong type checking
    - Automatic memory management
    - Exception handling
    - Security manager for runtime checks
    - No pointer arithmetic
    - Bytecode verification

4. **Performance**
    - JIT (Just-In-Time) compilation
    - Multi-threading support
    - Optimized bytecode execution
    - Garbage collection
    - HotSpot optimization

5. **Rich Standard Library**
    - Extensive built-in APIs
    - Collections framework
    - Network programming utilities
    - Database connectivity
    - GUI development tools


## Installation Guide

### 1. Download JDK
- Visit [Oracle's Java Downloads](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/)
- Select your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux)
- Download the latest LTS (Long Term Support) version
- Choose the appropriate architecture (x64, ARM)

### 2. Installation Steps
#### Windows:
1. Double-click the downloaded `.exe` file
2. Accept license agreement
3. Choose installation directory
4. Wait for installation to complete
5. Click 'Close' when finished

#### macOS:
1. Open the downloaded `.dmg` file
2. Double-click the package installer
3. Follow the installation wizard
4. Enter administrator password when prompted
5. Wait for completion

#### Linux:
1. Open terminal
2. Extract the downloaded archive:
    ```bash
    tar -xvf jdk-[version].tar.gz
    ```
3. Move to /opt directory:
    ```bash
    sudo mv jdk-[version] /opt/java
    ```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
#### Windows:
1. Open System Properties → Advanced → Environment Variables
2. Create new System Variable:
    - JAVA_HOME = C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-[version]
3. Add to Path:
    - %JAVA_HOME%\bin

#### Linux/Mac:
Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/opt/java
export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
```

### 4. Verify Installation
Open terminal/command prompt:
```bash
java --version    # Shows Java runtime version
javac --version   # Shows Java compiler version
```

## First Java Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
     public static void main(String[] args) {
          System.out.println("Hello, Java World!");
     }
}
```

### How to Run
1. Save as `HelloWorld.java`
2. Compile: `javac HelloWorld.java`
3. Run: `java HelloWorld`

## Next Steps
- Set up an IDE (VS Code, Eclipse, or IntelliJ)
- Learn Java syntax and concepts
- Practice with simple programs
- Join Java communities
